# End-to-End DWBI Project: Real-Life Data Integration with Snowflake, Python, SQL & PowerBI

 A Real-Life Data Warehouse and Business Intelligence (DWBI) project! In this repository, we'll walk you through the complete process of loading data into Snowflake using Python, performing powerful SQL queries, and visualizing data through a dynamic PowerBI dashboard.

The project is structured into several key components:

- **On Prem DB**: Includes tasks like extracting CSV files, generating historical sales data, and creating dimensional data.
- **Facts**: Focuses on Snowflake dimensions and Power BI dashboards.
- **Ad hoc Query**: Handles Excel reference data and other queries.

## Key Learnings

Throughout this project, you will learn about:

- **Data Model**: Project flow, ERD, table structure, star and snowflake schema, and relationships.
- **Python**: Libraries, Pandas, reading from Excel, CSV generation, and test data generation.
- **Snowflake**: Account creation, basics, object creation, loading data, and connectivity with PowerBI.
- **SQL**: Writing queries, handling scenarios, and using the WITH clause.
- **Power BI**: Power Query, blueprint creation, data modeling, and report generation.

## Tables and Entities
